üìã Overview
This repository contains the complete ROS 2 workspace for the Puzzlebot, a differential mobile robot platform designed for advanced control, navigation, and perception practices. The workspace integrates all packages, drivers, and configurations developed for both simulation and real hardware execution (Jetson + encoders).
‚ú® Key Features

Modular Architecture: Clean separation of components for easy extension and modification
Hardware Integration: Seamless connection with Jetson-based hardware and encoders
Advanced Control: PID controllers for precise movement and trajectory following
Computer Vision: Real-time image processing for object tracking and traffic light detection
Navigation System: Waypoint navigation with path planning capabilities
Simulation Support: Full compatibility with Gazebo for testing before hardware deployment
